# End-to-End Speech Recognition System Using Connectionist Temporal Classification
Automatic speech recognition (ASR) system implementation that utilizes the 
[connectionist temporal classification (CTC)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.75.6306)
cost function.
It's inspired by Baidu's
[Deep Speech: Scaling up end-to-end speech recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5567)
and
[Deep Speech 2: End-to-End Speech Recognition in English and Mandarin](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02595)
papers.
The system is trained on a combined corpus, containing 900+ hours.
It achieves a word error rate (WER) of 12.6% on the test dataset, without the use of an external
language model.

![Deep Speech 1 and 2 network architectures](images/network-architectures.png)

(a) shows the Deep Speech (1) model and (b) a version of the Deep Speech 2 model architecture. 


## Installation
The system was tested on Arch Linux and Ubuntu 16.04, with Python version 3.5+ and the 1.12.0 
version of [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). It's highly recommended to use TensorFlow 
with GPU support for training.


### Arch Linux
```terminal
# Install dependencies.
sudo pacman -S sox python-tensorflow-opt-cuda tensorbaord

# Install optional dependencies. LaTeX is only required to plot nice looking graphs.
sudo pacman -S texlive-most

# Clone reposetory and install Python depdendencies.
git clone https://github.com/mdangschat/ctc-asr.git
cd speech
git checkout <release_tag>

# Setup optional virtual environment.
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Ubuntu
Be aware that the [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) file lists `tensorflow` as dependency, 
if you install TensorFlow through [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) consider removing it as 
dependency and install `tensorflow-gpu` instead.
It could also be worth it to [build TensorFlow from source](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source).

```terminal
# Install dependencies.
sudo apt install python3-tk sox libsox-fmt-all

# Install optional dependencies. LaTeX is only required to plot nice looking graphs.
sudo apt install texlive

# Clone reposetory and install Python depdendencies. Don't forget to use tensorflow-gpu.
git clone https://github.com/mdangschat/ctc-asr.git
cd speech
git checkout <release_tag>

# Setup optional virtual environment.
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


## Configuration
The network architecture and training parameters can be configured by adding the appropriate flags
or by directly editing the [`asr/params.py`](asr/params.py) configuration file.
The default configuration requires quite a lot of VRAM (about 16 GB), consider reducing the number of units per
layer (`num_units_dense`, `num_units_rnn`) and the amount of RNN layers (`num_layers_rnn`).


## Corpus
There is list of some [free speech corpora](#free-speech-corpora) at the end of this section.
However, the corpus is not part of this repository and has to be acquired by each user.
For a quick start there is the [speech-corpus-dl](https://github.com/mdangschat/speech-corpus-dl) 
helper, that downloads a few free corpora, prepares the data and creates a merged corpus.

All audio files have to be 16 kHz, mono, WAV files.
For my trainings, I removed examples shorter than 0.7 and longer than 17.0 seconds.
Additionally, TEDLIUM examples with labels of fewer than 5 words have also been removed.

The following tree shows a possible structure for the required directories:
```terminal
./ctc-asr
├── asr
    ├── [...]
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── testruns.md
./ctc-asr-checkpoints
└── 3c2r2d-rnn
    ├── [...]
./speech-corpus
├── cache
├── corpus
│   ├── cvv2
│   ├── LibriSpeech
│   ├── tatoeba_audio_eng
│   └── TEDLIUM_release2
├── corpus.json
├── dev.csv
├── test.csv
└── train.csv
```
Assuming that this repository is cloned into `some/folder/ctc-asr`, then by default
the CSV files are expected to be in `some/folder/speech-corpus` and the audio files in
`some/folder/speech-corpus/corpus`.
TensorFlow checkpoints are written into `some/folder/ctc-asr-checkpoints`.
Both folders (`ctc-asr-checkpoints` and `speech-corpus`) must exist, they can be changed
in the [asr/params.py](asr/params.py) file.


### CSV
The CSV files (e.g. train.csv) have the following format:
```csv
path;label;length
relative/path/to/example;lower case transcription without puntuation;3.14159265359
[...]
```
Where `path` is the relative WAV path from the `DATA_DIR/corpus/` directory (String).
By default, `label` is the lower case transcription without punctuation (String).
Finally, `length` is the audio length in seconds (Float).

## Usage
### Training
Start training by invoking `asr/train.py`.
Use `asr/train.py -- --delete` to start a clean run and remove the old checkpoints.
Please note that all commands are expected to be executed from the projects root folder.
The additional `--` before the actual flags begin is used to indicate the end of IPython flags.

The training progress can be monitored using Tensorboard.
To start Tensorboard use `tensorboard --logdir <checkpoint_directory>`.
By default it can then be accessed via [localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006).


### Evaluation
Evaluate the current model by invoking `asr/evaluate.py`.
Use `asr/evaluate.py -- --dev` to run on the development dataset, instead of the test set.


### Prediction
To evaluate a given 16 kHz, mono WAV file use `asr/predict.py --input <wav_path>`.
